Hibernate Dirty checking:--
------------------------------
Dirty Checking  is one of the features of hibernate. In dirty checking, hibernate automatically detects whether
an object is modified (or) not and need to be updated. As long as the object is in persistent state 
i.e., bound to a particular Session(org.hibernate.Session). Hibernate monitors any changes to the objects and executes sql.

Note:- For dirty checking to work, the object must exist in cache.

Example:--

Employee employee = session.get(Employee.class, 2);
		if(employee != null) {
			session.beginTransaction();
			employee.setSalary(65000.00);
//			session.update(employee);
			session.getTransaction().commit();
			
		}else {
			System.out.println("Employee dosen't exist with provided id,,,.");
		}
difference between session.load() adn session.get():--
----------------------------------------------------------

session.load(): if record is not found in the database it will return object not found or proxy it will return 
session.get(): if record is not found in the database it will return null pointer exception.
