We can prevent(stop) a Thread execution by using the following methods.
1. yield()
2. join()
3. sleep()

yield(): 
1. Yield() method causes to pause the current execution thread and giving the chance of remaining waiting threads of same priority.
2. If all waiting threads are low priority or if there is no waiting threads then the same thread will be continued.
3. If several waiting threads with same priority available then we can't expect exact which thread will get chance for execution.
4. The thread which is yielded when it get chance once again for execution it depends on mercy of the thread sheduler.

public class ThreadYieldDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		
		Mythread thread = new Mythread();
		thread.start();
		for(int i=0;i<5;i++) {
			System.out.println("Main thread");
		}
	}

}

class Mythread extends Thread{
	
	@Override
	public void run() {
		for(int i=0;i<5;i++) {
			Thread.yield();
			System.out.println("Child Thread");
		}
	}
}


join():-
1. If a thread wants to wait() until completing some other thread then we should go for join() method.
example:
If a Thread  t1 executes t2.join() then t1 should go for waiting state until completing t2.

public class Threadjoindemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

		Mythred1 t1 = new Mythred1();
		t1.start();
		t1.join();
		for(int i=0;i<5;i++) {
			System.out.println("Rama thread.");
		}
	}

}
class Mythred1 extends Thread{
	
	@Override
	public void run() {

		for(int i=0;i<5;i++) {
			System.out.println("seetha thread");
			try {
				Thread.sleep(2000);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
	}
	
}

If a thread calls notify() on any object , it releases the lock of that object but may not immediately.
Except wait,notify,notifyall there is no other method where thread releases the lock.
Which of the following is valid
1. If a thread calls wait() immediately it will entered into waiting state with out releasing any lock invalid
2. If a thread calls wait() it releases the lock of that object,but may not immediately invalid
3. If a thread calls wait() on any object it releases all locks acquired by that thread and immediately entered into waiting state invalid.
4. If a thread calls wait() on any object it immediately releases the lock of that particular object and entered into waiting state. valid
5. If a thread calls notify() on any object it immediately relases the lock of that particular object invalid.
6. If a thread calls notify() on any object it releases the lock of that object , but may not immediately  valid.


Inter thread communication:--
------------------
Synchronized threads to communicate to each other


public class BankAccount {
	
	private int amount=10000;
	
	synchronized void withdraw(int amount){
		
		System.out.println("Going to withdraw.....");
		if(this.amount < amount){
			System.out.println("Less balance,waiting for deposit....");
			try{
				wait();
			}catch(Exception e)
			{
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
		this.amount -= amount;
		System.out.println("Withdraw completed...");
		
	}

	synchronized void deposit(int amount){
		System.out.println("Going to deposit");
		this.amount +=amount;
		System.out.println("deposit completed..");
		notify();
	}
}
public class Sample {

	
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		final BankAccount bankAccount =  new BankAccount();
		new Thread("Thread 1"){
			public void run() {
				bankAccount.withdraw(50000);
			};
		}.start();
		
		new Thread("Thread 2"){
			public void run() {
				bankAccount.deposit(80000);
			};
		}.start();
	}

}
2. 
public class InterThreadCommunication {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
	
		
		ThreadA t1= new ThreadA();
		t1.start();
		
		synchronized (t1) {
			
			System.out.println("main thread calling wait method");
			t1.wait();
			System.out.println("main thread got notification");
			System.out.println(t1.total);
		}
	}
}

class ThreadA extends Thread{

	int total=0;
	
	@Override
	public void run() {
		synchronized (this) {
			
			System.out.println("Child thread starts caliculating.");
			
			for(int i=1;i<=10;i++) {
				total =total+i;
			}
			System.out.println("child thread giving notification");
			this.notify();
		}
	}
}

Locks:--
---------------
ReentrantLock:-- It is the implementation class of Lock interface and it is the direct child class of object.
                 Reentrant means a thread can acquire same lock multiple times without any issue.
		 internally reentrant lock increments threads personal count whenever we called lock method and
		 decrements count value whenever thread calls unlock() and lock will be released, whenever count reaches 
		 zero.
Constructors:--
---------------- ReentrantLock l = new ReentrantLock();
                creates an instance of reentrant lock .
	    2.  ReentrantLock l = new ReentrantLock(boolean fairness); creates reentrant lock with given fairness policy 
	        it the fairness is true then longest waiting thread can acquire the lock if it is available i.e it follows
		First come first serve policy, if fairness is false then which waiting thread will get the chance we cant 
		expect.
		The default value for fairness is False.
		which of the folloing declarations are equal.
		ReentrantLock l = new ReentranctLock();
		ReentrantLock l2 = new ReentranctLock(true);
		ReentrantLock l3 = new ReentranctLock(false); 
		All the above if 1 and l3 rd are equal
		
		Important methods of ReentrantLock:--
		void lock()
		boolean trylock()
		boolean trylock(Long l,TimeUnit t)
		void lockinterruptibly()
		void unlock()
		

public class ReentrantLockDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Display d = new Display();
		Mythread t1 = new Mythread(d, "muthu");
		Mythread t2 = new Mythread(d, "raju");
		Mythread t3 = new Mythread(d, "dakshith");

		t1.start();
		t2.start();
		t3.start();
	}
}

class Mythread extends Thread{
	
	Display d;
	String name;
	
	public Mythread(Display d,String name) {
		this.d = d;
		this.name = name;
	}
	
	public void run() {
		d.wish(name);
	}
}



class Display {

	ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
	
	public  void wish(String name) {
		
		lock.lock(); ------> line 1
		
		for(int i=0;i<5;i++) {
			
			System.out.print("Good Morning :");
            
			try {
				Thread.sleep(2000);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
			
			System.out.println(name);
		}
		lock.unlock(); -----> line 2
	}
}	

If we comment line 1 and line2 then the thread will be executed simuntaneously and we will get irregular output.
If we are not commenting lines1 and 2 then threads will be executed one by one and we will get regular output.
	   
-----------------------------------

public class SynchronizedDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Display d = new Display();
		Mythread t1 = new Mythread(d, "muthu");
		Mythread t2 = new Mythread(d, "raju");
		Mythread t3 = new Mythread(d, "dakshith");

		t1.start();
		t2.start();
		t3.start();
	}
}

class Mythread extends Thread{
	
	Display d;
	String name;
	
	public Mythread(Display d,String name) {
		this.d = d;
		this.name = name;
	}
	
	public void run() {
		d.wish(name);
	}
}



class Display {

	public  synchronized void wish(String name) {

				Thread.sleep(2000);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();

			System.out.println(name);
		}
		
	}
}

Demo of trylock():---
--------------------
class Mythread3 extends Thread{
	
	static ReentrantLock l = new ReentrantLock();
	
	public Mythread3(String name) {
		super(name);
		
	}
	
	@Override
	public void run() {
		
		if(l.tryLock()) {
			System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+",,,,,,got lock performing safe operations.");
			
			try {
				Thread.sleep(2000);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
			l.unlock();
		}else {
			System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+",,,,,,unable to get lock and hence performing alternative  operations.");
		}
	}
	
}


public class TrylockDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Mythread3 t1 = new Mythread3("First thread");
		Mythread3 t2 = new Mythread3("Second thread");
		
		t1.start();
		t2.start();
		
	}
}

trylock with time period:--
---------------------------
public class TrylockwithTimeperiod {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Mythread4 t1 = new Mythread4("First thread");
		Mythread4 t2 = new Mythread4("Second thread");
		
		t1.start();
		t2.start();
	}

}

class Mythread4 extends Thread{
	
	static ReentrantLock l = new ReentrantLock();
	
	Mythread4(String name){
		super(name);
	}
	
	@Override
	public void run() {

		do {
			
		try{
			if(l.tryLock(5000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
				System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+"..got lock");
				
				Thread.sleep(30000);
				l.unlock();
				
				System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+"..releases lock");
				break;
			}else {
				System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+"..unable to get lock  and will try again");
			}
			
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
			
		}while(true);
	}
	
}

Executor Framework:--
----------------------
Creating a new thread for every job may creates performance and memory problems. we should go for thread pool.
Thread pool is a pool of already created threads, ready to do our job.
Java 1.5 version introduces thread pool framework to implement thread pools.
Thread pool framework also knows as executor framework.
We can create a thread pool as follows 

ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

we can submit a runnable job by using submit method.

service.submit(job);

we can shutdown executorservice by using service.shutdown();

public class ExecutorServiceDemo {

	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Printjob[] jobs= {
				          new Printjob("Muthu"),
				          new Printjob("Raju"),
				          new Printjob("Dakshith"),
				          new Printjob("Krishna"),
				          new Printjob("Mamatha"),
						 };
		
		ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
		
		for(Printjob job:jobs) {
			service.submit(job);
		}
		service.shutdown();
	}
}

class Printjob implements Runnable{
	
	String name;
	
	Printjob(String name){
		this.name = name;
	}

	@Override
	public void run() {

		System.out.println(name+"...Job Started by Thread:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
		
		try {
			Thread.sleep(2000);
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		System.out.println(name+"...Job Completed by Thread:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
	}
	
	
}

In the above example 3 threads are responsible to execute 6 jobs
so that a single thread can be reused for multiple jobs.
While designing webservers and appliction servers we can use thread pool concept.

wait(),notify(),notifyall() are present in object class not in thread class, because thread can call theses methods on any
java object.
To call wait(),notify(),notifyall() methods on any object,thread should be owner of that object,i.e the thread should has
lock of that object.i.e the thread should be inside synchronized area.
Hence we can call wait(),notify(),notifyall() only from synchronized area otherwise we will get runtime exception,
saying illegalmonitorstate exception.

If a thread calls wait() method on any object,it immediately relaeses the lock of that particular object and entered into
waiting state.

CountDownlatch:--
CountDownlatch is advanced type of synchronization.
Here all threads as to wait for complete their tasks.
For example 
 where a Organziation needs to recruite 3 Java Developers.
 For this HR Manager has asked 3 Tech Leads to take interview.
 The HR Manager wants to distribute the Offer letter only after all the 3 Java Developers have been recruited
 In Threading terminology the HR Manger should wait till 3 Java Developers have been recruited.

1.
 import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
public class TechLead extends Thread{

 CountDownLatch countDownLatch;
 public TechLead(CountDownLatch countDownLatch,String name){
  super(name);
  this.countDownLatch=countDownLatch;
  
 }
 
 @Override
 public void run() {
  try {
   
   Thread.sleep(2000);
  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
   // TODO Auto-generated catch block
   e.printStackTrace();
  }
  // TODO Auto-generated method stub
  System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+" : recruted");
  
  countDownLatch.countDown();
 }

}

import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;


public class HRManager {
 
 public static void main(String args[]){
  CountDownLatch countDownLatch = new CountDownLatch(3);
  
  TechLead techLead1 = new TechLead(countDownLatch,"first");
  TechLead techLead2 = new TechLead(countDownLatch,"second");
  TechLead techLead3 = new TechLead(countDownLatch,"third");
  
  
  techLead1.start();
  techLead2.start();
  techLead3.start();
  
  try {
   System.out.println("HR Manager waiting for recruitment to complete...");
   
   countDownLatch.await();
   
   System.out.println("Distribute Offer Letter");
  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
   e.printStackTrace();
  }
 }
}

2.
package prac;

import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class DevTeam extends Thread{

	private CountDownLatch countDownLatch;
	
	public DevTeam(CountDownLatch countDownLatch,String name) {
		super(name);
		this.countDownLatch = countDownLatch;
	}
	
	@Override
	public void run() {
		
		System.out.println("Task assigned to development team "+Thread.currentThread().getName());
		
		try {
			Thread.sleep(2000);
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		
		System.out.println("Task finished by development team "+Thread.currentThread().getName());
		
		// Each thread calls countDown() method on task completion.
		countDownLatch.countDown();
	}
	
}
package prac;

import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class AssignTaskManagerTest {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

		//created countdownlatch for 2 threads
		CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(2);
		
		//created and started two threads
		DevTeam teamA = new DevTeam(latch, "dev-A");
		DevTeam teamB = new DevTeam(latch, "dev-B");
		
		teamA.start();
		teamB.start();
		
		//when two threads(dev-A and dev-B)completed tasks are returned
		latch.await();
		
		//Now execution of thread(QA team) started.
		QATeam qateam = new QATeam("QA Team");
		qateam.start();
		
		
	}

}
package prac;

public class QATeam extends Thread{
	
	public QATeam(String name) {
		super(name);
	}
	
	@Override
	public void run() {
		
		System.out.println("Task assigned to "+Thread.currentThread().getName());
		
		try {
			Thread.sleep(2000);
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		
		System.out.println("Task finished by "+Thread.currentThread().getName());
	}
