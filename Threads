We can prevent(stop) a Thread execution by using the following methods.
1. yield()
2. join()
3. sleep()

yield(): 
1. Yield() method causes to pause the current execution thread and giving the chance of remaining waiting threads of same priority.
2. If all waiting threads are low priority or if there is no waiting threads then the same thread will be continued.
3. If several waiting threads with same priority available then we can't expect exact which thread will get chance for execution.
4. The thread which is yielded when it get chance once again for execution it depends on mercy of the thread sheduler.
