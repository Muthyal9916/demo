Simple Network Management Protocal:- It is introduced in 1988,before that SGMP (Simple Gatway Management of Protocal)
---------------------------------
1. It is nothing but Manager-Agent Model
2. It works Based on MIB(Management Information Base) -- This is nothing but set of commands
3. If we want to communicate Manager-Agent Model we have to use MIB.
4. If we want to see whether two systems having connectivity or not using Ping command in SNMP
   Ping will send echo packets to those systems , if we will not receive echo response then it will say there is not connection
   between the systems.
5. Spiceworks,Zabbix,OpenNms are software in this software we have snmp for tracking the LAN information.
6. Installing SNMP in that system we can call Manager remaining systems we can call Agents.
7. We have two main features
   1. getResponse
   2. Traps
8.
