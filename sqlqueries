SqlInjection:--
-----------------------------
Building sql statements dynamically, by concatenating strings can cause Sqlinjection.
2ways to avoid SqlInjection.
1. Use Parameterized Queries
2. Use Stored procedures.


department wise highest salary:--
select max(sal),deptno
from emp
group by deptno



Getting the 2nd height salary:--
--------------------------------
1.  select max(sal) from emp where sal < (select max(sal) from emp);

3rd heigth salary:--
---------------------
select max(sal) from emp where sal < (select max(sal) from emp where sal <(select max(sal) from emp));

Innerjoin:--
--------------------
It will display matching values in both tables
select emp.deptno from emp INNER JOIN dept on emp.deptno = dept.deptno;


Left Outer join:--
----------------
It will display table from left side along matching records with table
select * from emp
left join 
dept on emp.deptno = dept.deptno;

Rigth Join:--
It will display right table along with matching records with another table.

select * from emp
right join 
dept on emp.deptno = dept.deptno;



select emp.deptno,emp.ENAME from emp
INNER JOIN dept on emp.DEPTNO = dept.DEPTNO;

Natural Join:--
-------------C
Column having same name and same datatype present in both tables to be joined.

select * from emp
NATURAL JOIN
dept;


example:--
select emp.deptno,emp.ENAME from emp
INNER JOIN dept on emp.DEPTNO = dept.DEPTNO;

Full Join:--
It will display both tables along with matching records.

select * from emp
full join 
dept on emp.deptno = dept.deptno;


delete :--
--------------------
This can be used to delete the table data temporarliy, and we can rollback.
delete from emp;

truncate:-- 
this can be used to delete the enitre table data permanently anc we can't rollback.
truncate table tablename

drop:--
This can be used to drop the database object permanently , can't rollback.
drop table tablename.


-- create a new table from existing table:--
create table emp1 as select * from emp;


alter:--
alter table emp1 add(address varchar2(22));
alter table emp1 drop column address;

rename:--
rename second to first;

update:-
update first set address='Bangalore' where deptno=10;


Like:--
starts with 's' -- select * from first where ename like 'S%'
Second letter starts with 'A' -- select * from first where ename like '_A%';
any position -- select * from first where ename like '%A%';

Group By:--

select deptno,ename,count(*) from first
group by
deptno,ename;

Using order by
select deptno,ename,count(*) from first
group by
deptno,ename order by ename desc;
