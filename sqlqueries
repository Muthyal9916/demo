SqlInjection:--
-----------------------------
Building sql statements dynamically, by concatenating strings can cause Sqlinjection.
2ways to avoid SqlInjection.
1. Use Parameterized Queries
2. Use Stored procedures.


department wise highest salary:--
select max(sal),deptno
from emp
group by deptno



Getting the 2nd height salary:--
--------------------------------
1.  select max(sal) from emp where sal < (select max(sal) from emp);

3rd heigth salary:--
---------------------
select max(sal) from emp where sal < (select max(sal) from emp where sal <(select max(sal) from emp));

Innerjoin:--
--------------------
It will display matching values in both tables
select emp.deptno from emp INNER JOIN dept on emp.deptno = dept.deptno;


Left Outer join:--
----------------
It will display table from left side along matching records with table
select * from emp
left join 
dept on emp.deptno = dept.deptno;

Rigth Join:--

select * from emp
right join 
dept on emp.deptno = dept.deptno;



select emp.deptno,emp.ENAME from emp
INNER JOIN dept on emp.DEPTNO = dept.DEPTNO;

Natural Join:--
-------------C
Column having same name and same datatype present in both tables to be joined.
