// internals SpringBootAppliction.run() method
Step:1 Spring boot application execution will start from main method which is in start class.
Step:2 As part of main method we will call SpringBootApplication.run(..) method.
Step:3 SpringBootApplication.run(...) method performs bootstraping for spring boot application.
Step:4 Starts StopWatch to identify time taken to bootstrap Spring boot application.

Step:7 Refresh Context
Step:8 Print Banner(Spring Logo will be printed on console)
Step:9 Trigger Runners(Application Runner and Command line runner)
