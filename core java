MethodOverloading:--
------------------
Step1: Automatic promotion in overloading
        While resolving overloaded methods if exact matched method is not available , then we wont get any compile time error
        immediately , first it will promote argument to the next level and check whether matched method is available or not,if 
        matched method is available then it will be considered,and if the matched method is not available then compiler promotes 
        arguments once again to the next level, this process will be continued untill all possible promotions,still if the matched
        method is not available then we will get compile time error. the following are all possible promotions in overloading.
        
        byte-short-int-long-float-double
        char-int

example:-- 

public class ClassA {

	
	public void  m1(int i) {
		System.out.println("int args");
	}
	

	public void  m1(float f) {
		System.out.println("float args");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		ClassA a = new ClassA();
		a.m1('a');
		a.m1(10l);
		
	}
}

Step2:--
public class ClassA {

	public void m1(String s) {
		System.out.println("String version");
	}
	
	public void m1(Object o) {
		System.out.println("Object version");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		ClassA a = new ClassA();
		a.m1(null);
		a.m1(null);
		
	}
}


Note: while resolving overloaded methods compiler will always gives the presidence for child type arguments then compared with
parent type arguments.


Step3:- 
public class ClassA {
	
	public void m1(String s) {
		System.out.println("String version");
	}
	
	public void m1(StringBuffer sb) {
		System.out.println("stringbuffer version");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ClassA a = new ClassA();
		a.m1("durga");
		a.m1(new StringBuffer("durga"));
		a.m1(null);
	}
}
Note : In this case both string and string buffer are same level, it will throw ambigues error

Step4:--
public class ClassA {
	
	public void m1(int i,float f) {
		System.out.println("String version");
	}
	
	public void m1(float f,int i) {
		System.out.println("Object version");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		ClassA a = new ClassA();
		a.m1(10,10.5f);
		a.m1(10,10);//compilation error
		a.m1(10.5f,10.5f); // compilation error
		
	}
}

Step5:
public class ClassA {
	
	public void m1(int x) {
		System.out.println("String version");
	}
	
	public void m1(int... x) {
		System.out.println("Object version");
	}
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		ClassA a = new ClassA();
		a.m1();
		a.m1(10,20,30,40,50);
	       a.m1(10);
	}
}

In general var-args method will get least priority ie. if no other method matched then only var arg method will get the 
chance , It exactly same as default case inside switch.





In Methodoverriding method names and argument types must be matched i.e method signatures must be same.

co-varient return type:
-------------------------
In overriding return types must be same, but this rule is applicable until 1.4 versionn only from 1.5 version onwards we can take 
co-varient return types -- Child class method return type need to be same as Parent class method return type,its child type also allowed,
                             It's applicable only for object types not for primitive type.

class Parent
{
  public Object m1()
  {
  return null;
  }
}
Class C extend Parent
{
public String m1()
{
  return null;
 }
} 

parent class method retrun type:-- object,Number,String,double
------------------------



child class method return type:--String/object,Number/integer,Object is not applicable because parent to parent is not possible,double only
-----------------------

Parent class private methods are not applicable for child class and hence overriding concept not applicable for private methods.

we can't override parent class final methods in child classes, if we are trying to override we will get compiletime error

How to define user defined Immutable class:--
---------------------------------------------
Step -1 : We can declare class as public final
Step -2 : We can declare properties as final
Step -3 : We can declare public constructor
Step -4 : we can declare only getter methods

public final class Immutable{
	
private final int a;
	
Immutable(int a){
		this.a = a;
	}

	public int getA() {
		return a;
	}
}


Exceptions:--
------------------
Default excepiton:--    Inside a method if any excepiton occurs the method in which it is raised is responsible to create 
exception object by including the following information.

1. Name of exception
2. Desciption of exception
3. Location at which exception occurs(stack trace)
                 
After creating exception object method handovers that object to the JVM
JVM will check wheather the method contains any excption handling code or not, if the method doesnt contain exception handling
code then JVM terminates that method obnarmally and removes corresponding entry from the stack.
Then JVM identifies caller() and checks wheather method contains any handling code or not. if the caller() doesnt conatin 
handling code JVM terminates that caller method also abnoramlly and removes corresponding from the stack. this process will be 
continued untill main method and if the main method also doesnt contain handling code then JVM terminates main method also.
And removes corresponding entry from the stack. Then jvm handovers responsibilty of exception handling to default exception
handler,which the part of JVM
Default exception handler prints exception information in the following format and terminates program abnormally

class not found exception:---
--------------------------
ClassNotFoundException is a run time exception which is thrown when an application tries to load a class at run time 
using Class.forName() or loadClass() or findSystemClass() methods and the class with specified name are not found 
in the classpath.

public class MainClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");
        }
        catch (ClassNotFoundException e)
        {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

NoClassDefFoundError:--
-----------------------
NoClassDefFoundError is an error which is thrown when Java Runtime System tries to load the definition of a class
and class definition is no longer available. The required class definition was present at compile time but it was 
missing at run time. For example, compile the below program.

class A
{
 
}
 
public class B
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        A a = new A();
    }
}

Outofmemory:-----
--------------------    The outofmemoryerror is thrown due to lack of available memory space.
