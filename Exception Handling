Stackoverflow error in java:--
------------------------------
1. Stackoverflow error is an error thrown at runtime .
2. when it encounters that your application/code has run out of the memory.
3. It may occur in case of recursive methods or a large amount of data is fetched from the server and stored in some object.
4. This error is generated by JVM.
5. When you execute too many methods one inside another 
6. It is thrown when your calling functions.

About stack memory:--
------------------
1. stack memory is used to store local variables and function call.
2. Each thread in java has there own stack which can be specified using -Xss JVM parameter.
3. If there is no memory left in stack for storing function call or local variable 
    JVM will throw java.lang.StackOverFlowError.
4. Variables stored in stacks are only visible to the own Thread.	

public class Sample {
	
	/*Sample(){
		System.out.println("Hello");
	}
	
	Sample samp = new Sample();
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Sample samp = new Sample();
	}
*/
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		try {
			keepCalling();
		}catch(StackOverflowError error) {
			System.out.println(error);
			System.out.println("StackOverflowError Error Happend.");
		}
	}
	
	private static void keepCalling() {
		int localvar =0;
		String str = new String();
		System.out.println("keepCalling till stack memory becomes empty.");
		keepCalling();
	}
}

OutOffMemoryerror:--
----------------------
 1. Happens when the JVM runs out of space to allocate the new objects, which are allocated on the heap
 2. While if there is no more heap space for creating object, JVM will throw java.lang.OutOffMemoryerror.
 3. It will thrown when your creating objects.
 
 Example:--
 package prac;

import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;

public class OutofMemoryErrorDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		String str="Muthu";
		
		List<String> list = new LinkedList<String>();
		while(true) {
			str+="Hi";
			list.add(str);
		}
		
	}

}
Difference between ClassNotfoundException and NoClassDefinition Found Error
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ClassNotfoundException :-
1. It occurs when JVM tries to load a class which is not present in the classpath.
2. It is checked exception.
NoClassDefFounderror:-
1. It occurs when class was present in class path at compile time but not present at runtime.
2. It is an error.
