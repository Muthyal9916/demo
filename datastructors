Linkedlist --
1. Linked list is a datastructure which is used to store the collection of data.
2. Linked list as a concept of Node , Node will have the data and address of next Node.
3. Head node will be pointing to the first node and the last node will be poinint to the null
4. Linked list will grow srink and dynamically.
5. Linked list will not waste the memory.

Single linked list:--
-----------
Single linked list will always transfers in forward direction we cant come to the backward direction
Single linked list node as the data and address of the next node
these nodes are created runtime based one the requirement.


Stack:--
1. It is nothing but LIFO 
2. It is Abstract data type
3. We have 3 methods, like push,pop,peek,
   push -- add
   peek -- find
   pop -- delete
   
 public class Runner {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Stack nums = new Stack();
		nums.push(15);
		nums.push(12);
		System.out.println(nums.peek());
		nums.push(8);
		System.out.println(nums.pop());
		nums.show();
	}
}

public class Stack {

	int stack[] = new int[5];
	int top =0;
	
	public void  push(int data) {
		stack[top] = data;
		top++;
	}
	
	public int pop() {
		
		int data;
		top--;
		data=stack[top];
		stack[top]=0;
		return data;
	}
	
	public int peek() {
		int data;
		data = stack[top-1];
		return data;
	}
	
	public void show() {
		
		for(int n:stack) {
			System.out.println(n + " ");
		}
	}
}
