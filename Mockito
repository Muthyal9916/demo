Mocking is a process of creating substitue object for real object.
Mocking is very important as part of Unit testing.
There are two types mock frameworks are available
1. Proxy based (EasyMock , Mockito)
2. Byte code manipulation (PowerMock,JMockit)

@Test
public void testgetNameById(){

//Creating proxy
 ContactDao daoProxy = EasyMock.createMock(ContactDao.class);
 
 //setting behaviour for proxy
 EasyMock.expect(daoProxy.findNameById(101)).andReturn("Ashok");
 
 EasyMock.replay(daoProxy);
