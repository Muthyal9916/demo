In Methodoverriding method names and argument types must be matched i.e method signatures must be same.

co-varient return type:
-------------------------
In overriding return types must be same, but this rule is applicable until 1.4 versionn only from 1.5 version onwards we can take 
co-varient return types -- Child class method return type need to be same as Parent class method return type,its child type also allowed

class Parent
{
  public Object m1()
  {
  return null;
  }
}
Class C extend Parent
{
public String m1()
{
  return null;
 }
}
