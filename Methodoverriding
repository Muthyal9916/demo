In Methodoverriding method names and argument types must be matched i.e method signatures must be same.

co-varient return type:
-------------------------
In overriding return types must be same, but this rule is applicable until 1.4 versionn only from 1.5 version onwards we can take 
co-varient return types -- Child class method return type need to be same as Parent class method return type,its child type also allowed,
                             It's applicable only for object types not for primitive type.

class Parent
{
  public Object m1()
  {
  return null;
  }
}
Class C extend Parent
{
public String m1()
{
  return null;
 }
} 

parent class method retrun type:-- object,Number,String,double
------------------------



child class method return type:--String/object,Number/integer,Object is not applicable because parent to parent is not possible,double only
------------------------
