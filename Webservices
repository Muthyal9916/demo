Restful webservices:--
------------------------
Resource - What ever the data/response we will get from the server is knows as Resource.
Each Resource can be accessed by its URL's.
We can get the Resource from the Restful service in different format like HTML,XML,JSON,TEXT,PDF but we mainly prefer JSON only.
Rest guidelines always talks about stateless communication between client and the server.
Stateless means every single request from client to server will be considered as a fresh request.
Because of this reason Rest always prefers HTTP as it is a stateless protocal.

Caching:--
--------------------
Caching is process of storing server response in client side.so that a client needs not to make server request for same resource so 
many times.
