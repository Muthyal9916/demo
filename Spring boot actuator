Actuator Endpoints :-  Actuator endpoints let you monitor and interact with your appliction

Enabling Endpoints : 
By default, all endpoints except for shutdown are enabled.
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always

info.app.ecoding=UTF-8
info.app.java.source=1.8
info.app.java.target=1.8
info.name.of.app=User management application
management.endpoints.web.base-path=/userApp

#enabled endpoints
management.endpoint.health.enabled=false
management.endpoints.enabled-by-default=false
management.endpoint.info.enabled=true

Exposing Endpoints:-- 
 Endpoints may contain sensitive information, so careful consideration should be given about when to expose them.
 To change which endpoints are exposed, use the following technoloy-specific include and exclude properties.
 
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=beans,metrics
#management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

Configuring Endpoints:--
Endpoints automatically caches the response which dont take any parameter
We can controll this feature as follows
management.endpoint.beans.cache.time-to-live=10s
The prefix management.endpoint.<name> is used to uniquely identify the endpoint that is being configured.

Implementing Custom Endpoints:--
Using @Endpoint
Rest Controller endpoint
