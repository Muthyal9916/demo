Spring Cloud:--
--------------
          Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems.
          e.g.(Configuration management,service discovery,circuit breakers,intelligent routing,micro-proxy,control bus,
          one-time tokens,global locks,leadership election,distributed sessions,cluster state.)
                    Using spring cloud developers can quickly stand up services and applications that implement those patterns,
           They will work well in any distributed environment.
                
Distributed Environments:--
----------------------------
          A Distributed system is a network that consists of autonomous computers that are connected using a distribution middleware.
 they help in sharing different resources and capabilities to provide users with a single and integrated  coherent network.        

Advantages and Disadvantages in Distributed Systems:--
-----------------------------------------

Advantages:-
----------
1. Shareability
2. Expandability
3. Local Autonomy
4. Improved performance
5. Improved reliability and availability
6. Potential cost reduces

Dis-Advantages:--
--------------
1. Network reliance
2. Complexities
3. Security
4. Multiple point of failure
