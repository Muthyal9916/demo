Microservices are independent service.
We can divide monolothic applications into small applications.
Each application works as service,
we can implement individually,independently.
Finally we can user Rest Apis to communicate to each servcies.Usually Http

Microservices architecture:- Every module is different independent deployable unit and connected each other by Rest Api.
Benefits:-- 
1. Each microservice is relatively small.
2. 

Drawbacks  of Microservices:--

Complexity of developing a distributed system
Implementing inter-process communication
Handling partial failures
Complexity of implementing business transactions that span multiple databases (with out 2PC)
Complexity of testing a distributed system
Complexity of developing and operating a distributed system
